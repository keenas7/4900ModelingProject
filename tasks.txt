Goals for Procedural Terrain Generation:
- Noise functions (Perlin, Simplex, or fractal noise) to generate height values. 
- Convert those height values into a mesh (OF primitives like ofMesh or ofPlanePrimitive and adjusting vertices).
- Understand coordinate mapping: how (x, y) maps to terrain height (z)
- Implement heightmap generation and mesh construction to create Noise-based heightmaps.
- Begin shaping terrain toward volcanic features (e.g., higher elevation in center, crater depressions).

Goals for Parametric Volcano Topology:
- Make the volcano itself adjustable, parametric, and reusable. “object-oriented”.
- Define a Volcano class (Parameters: height, crater radius, slope angle, lava vent width, etc.)
- Functions that can modify the base terrain mesh (controlling crater size, slope, and variation) using these parameters.
- shape volcanoes procedurally.
- this is the volcano parameter system.
- preapre to coordinate integration with UI if we get to this point.

Surface Texturing / Visualization
- Texture mapping, shading, and visuals. 
- design or source realistic textures.
- Applying textures to meshes. Map textures based on vertex coordinates or height.
- How to export or make textures (from photos or procedural noise).
